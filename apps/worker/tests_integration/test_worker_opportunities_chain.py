"""Opportunities chain integration test (real PostgreSQL, real migrations).

Synthetic daily bars + option chains -> ``ingest_envelope`` (which enqueues an
ADDITIONAL ``opportunities.refresh`` message per newly written bars/chain
observation) -> bounded worker run -> published ``opportunities/global``
snapshot read back through the repository.

Hard proofs, on real rows:

- NO candidate carrying a closed status (``BLOCKED`` / ``INSUFFICIENT_DATA``)
  sits in the qualified group, and no open status sits in the excluded group
  — both groups are traversed exhaustively, candidate by candidate;
- the distribution of exclusion reasons is published and COHERENT with the
  number of candidates (it accounts for every excluded candidate and for
  nothing else);
- ``profile_ref`` carries BOTH the manifest id and the manifest version;
- the ranking is stable across two executions: an identical drain
  republishes nothing (same version, same content hash) and a later clock
  moves only the time-derived fields, never the ordering.

Every fixture is SYNTHETIC and deterministic (fixed seed, fixed clock).
