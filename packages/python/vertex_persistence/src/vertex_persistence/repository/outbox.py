"""Transactional outbox operations (ADR-006, at-least-once semantics).

Enqueue happens inside the caller's business transaction, so a rollback drops
the business write and its message together. Workers claim rows with
``SELECT .. FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED``, hold a lease, then ack or fail. The
clock is always injected (``now``) — no hidden system time — which keeps
lease and backoff behavior deterministic under test.

Lease ownership: every claim stamps the row with an opaque, per-claim
``lease_token`` returned in :class:`ClaimedOutboxMessage`. ``ack_outbox`` and
``fail_outbox`` require that token, so a worker whose lease expired and was
reaped (or whose row was re-claimed by another worker) gets a typed
:class:`~vertex_persistence.errors.OutboxLeaseError` instead of silently
overwriting someone else's state. ``reap_expired_leases`` records the lost
attempt itself (FAILED with backoff, DEAD at ``max_attempts``), so an
attempt is never lost and a poisoned handler that always overruns its lease
still reaches DEAD (ADR-006: record attempt, lease and result).

``last_error`` stores a short technical diagnostic only, in one imposed safe
format: ``CODE:ExceptionType[: redacted message]``. ``fail_outbox`` refuses a
free-form string — it takes the exception itself plus a canonical error code
and renders ``last_error`` through
:func:`vertex_persistence.redaction.format_last_error`, so payload fragments,
secrets, SQL parameters, quoted values and long digit runs never reach the
column. The value is additionally truncated defensively.

    20 517 versions of ``attention`` and ``review_queue`` — one recompute and
    one publication per observation, although every one of these handlers
    recomputes from the WHOLE table and ignores the message payload. A batch
    of five hundred quotes only needs one recompute after the last one.

    RULE. At most one PENDING, unleased message per ``(topic, coalesce_key)``.
    A message that is already IN_PROGRESS (or FAILED and waiting for its
    retry) never absorbs a new job: its handler may have read the table
    before this transaction's row became visible, so a fresh PENDING message
    is enqueued behind it.

    RACE. The existing PENDING row is read ``FOR UPDATE`` inside the caller's
    transaction. :func:`claim_outbox_batch` claims with ``SKIP LOCKED``, so a
    worker cannot claim that row until this transaction commits — and once it
    does, the row it claims will see the observation committed here. If the
    worker claimed the row first, it is no longer PENDING and a new message
    is enqueued. No observation can therefore be left without a recompute.

    ``coalesce_key`` is written into the payload under
    :data:`COALESCE_KEY_FIELD`; handlers that read the payload keep every
