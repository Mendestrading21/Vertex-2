"""Simulation preview: wire DTOs and the vertex_core-only orchestration.

``POST /api/v1/simulations/preview`` evaluates one manually declared
structure against explicit assumptions. EVERY financial figure comes from
``vertex_core.calculations.options`` — the single calculation authority:

- structure certification: :func:`defined_risk_check` runs on EVERY request;
  a structure containing a short quantity that the strict closed catalogue
  does not certify is rejected 422 with the verifier's EXACT reason code
  (e.g. ``OUTSIDE_CLOSED_CATALOG``) — a short leg only exists inside a
  certified ``DEFINED_RISK`` structure;
- expiry P&L: :func:`payoff_at_expiry` (exact ``Decimal``) on the evaluation
  grid = declared spot grid, extended with every leg strike and the
  zero-spot bankruptcy tail (the breakpoints of the piecewise-linear payoff);
- before-expiry grid: :func:`scenario_grid` (single declared-volatility
  scenario) on the declared spot x time grid, bounded by the wire contract
  (max 41 spot points x 8 time points);
- breakevens: the payoff is piecewise linear between two adjacent evaluation
  points with no strike inbetween (strikes ARE evaluation points), so each
  sign change pins one crossing. The crossing point is solved exactly from
  the two authoritative payoff values and then CERTIFIED by re-evaluating
  ``payoff_at_expiry`` at the reported spot — the published residual is the
  authority's own figure (non-zero only through decimal quantization of the
  crossing spot). The API never prices anything itself;
- extremes: max gain / max loss OVER THE EVALUATION GRID, explicitly labeled
  as on-grid figures (a warning says gains beyond the grid are not
  asserted); the certified defined-risk verdict travels alongside.

The result is labeled ``value_nature = "THEORETICAL"``; both calculations
keep their ``CalculationRecord`` lineage. NOTHING is persisted — a preview
is a pure computation on declared inputs; it neither creates nor implies any
transaction.
